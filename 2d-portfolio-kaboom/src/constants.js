  pc: `This is my PC. I primarily work with C++ and Python these days,
    but I also enjoy JavaScript. Regardless of the language, programming itself excites me.
    Here is my <a href="https://github.com/Akshatsahay18" target="_blank">GitHub</a>!`,

  "cs-degree": `This is my ECE degree. I display it proudly as it represents years of dedication.
    Although the program was highly theoretical, it provided me with a strong technical foundation.`,

  "sofa-table": `This is my sofa, where I like to unwind and watch YouTube.
    I also spend time here working on programming projects. 
    My interests include game development, machine learning, and web development.`,

  tv: `This is my TV. Lately, I’ve been following technology channels to broaden my perspective across different fields. 
    People often say "a jack of all trades is a master of none," but they forget the full phrase —
    "oftentimes better than master of one." I believe versatility is a strength.`,

  bed: `This is where I sleep. Interestingly, many of my best ideas come to me while I’m lying here. 
    I keep a habit of writing them down immediately; otherwise, I can’t rest until I capture the thought.`,

  projects: `This portfolio itself is one of my projects. 
    It’s built using the Kaboom.js library for game development in JavaScript.
    The text you’re reading is styled with HTML and CSS, rather than being rendered directly in the canvas.`,

  library: `These are my shelves filled with programming books. 
    I admit, I’ve only read a few cover-to-cover, but I find value in collecting them as references and inspiration. 
    Many developers can probably relate to buying technical books faster than they can finish them.`,
