  pc: `This is my PC. I primarily work with C++ and Python these days,

  "cs-degree": `This is my ECE degree. I display it proudly as it represents years of dedication.
    Although the program was highly theoretical, it provided me with a strong technical foundation.`,

  "sofa-table": `This is my sofa, where I like to unwind and watch YouTube.
    I also spend time here working on programming projects. 
    My interests include game development, data analysis and frontend development .`,

  tv: `This is my TV. Lately, I’ve been following technology channels to broaden my perspective across different fields. 
    People often say "a jack of all trades is a master of none," but they forget the full phrase —
    "oftentimes better than master of one." I believe versatility is a strength.`,

    It’s built using the Kaboom.js library for game development in JavaScript.
    The text you’re reading is styled with HTML and CSS, rather than being rendered directly in the canvas.`,

  library: `These are my shelves filled with programming books. 
    I admit, I’ve only read a few cover-to-cover, but I find value in collecting them as references and inspiration. 
    Many developers can probably relate to buying technical books faster than they can finish them.`,
